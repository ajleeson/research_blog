## Bonus Figures

This week I'd like to mostly focus on the thesis outline attached in our agenda.

However, I have included a few figures in this blog post to keep you updated on my current research status.

## Average Bottom DO

Last week, I discovered that the hypoxic season in Puget Sound extends from May 1 - Nov 30 (for 2013, at least.)
Figure 1 shows the average bottom DO in Puget Sound during this season.

## Bit reproducibility

This week I also launched the 2014 run. 

The following figures show differences between the anthropogenic (long hindcast) and natural (my current test) conditions on 2014.01.09. Figure 2 shows that I correctly removed DIN from the natural run. Figures 3 - 4 show that I properly initialized the run so that the velocities are bit reproducible.
