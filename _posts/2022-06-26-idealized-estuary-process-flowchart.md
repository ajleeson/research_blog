As I've been modifying idealized estuary runs, I've found it increasingly important to understand how the LO system and ROMS interact with each other.

For me it's helpful to visualize this workflow. Based on the [LO READMEs](https://github.com/parkermac/LO/blob/main/notes/analytical_runs.md), I've thus created a process flowchart that maps out the steps to running an idealized estuary model.
