## Model Run Checklist

This blog post serves as a checklist for all the little loose ends that I need to tie up before launching new model runs.

- [x] Set up header file and compile ROMS on klone (x10ab)
    - [ ] Define daily averages
    - [ ] Use new fennel.h with 50% particle burial and corrected carbon burial 
- [ ] Get latest version of ROMS
    - [ ] Delete older varinfo files on local pc/perigee/apogee
    - [ ] Git pull latest version of ROMS on klone <span style="color:red">(Do this once hyak maintenance is complete!)</span>
- [ ] Set up daily averages
