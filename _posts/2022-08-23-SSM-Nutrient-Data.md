## Salish Sea Model Nutrient Data

### Data Available

Timeseries data from 1999 - July 2017 in .xlsx files.

Includes marine point sources and nonpoint sources (such as river mouths).

99 total point sources. 
161 total nonpoint sources.

The timeseries data are in an individual excel file for each point source and nonpoint source.

Point sources provide data on a monthly basis.
Nonpoint sources have data on a daily basis.

Both point and nonpoint source files provide data for the same variables. However, the variable names differ slightly between the point source and nonpoint source files. A summary of the variables are provided in the table below:
