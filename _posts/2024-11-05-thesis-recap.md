## Thesis Recap and Next Steps

It feels so good to finally have the MS defense behind me, and I'm so thankful for all of the feedback and questions I received. I am also happy to come out of this experience with a written document that will serve as the foundation for my first paper.

My goal is to complete the thesis this week, and collect final signatures when we all meet the following Wednesday.

Below I have summarized my remaining questions for the thesis and listed some next steps for the paper.

## Remaining questions for thesis

1. I will include another example inlet in the model evaluation section. Is it still valuable to include Lynch Cove?
2. Should I omit shallow inlets from the analysis in the thesis, or wait for the paper?
3. What is a good term to represent DO concentration? C_DO? I will otherwise try to be more explicit about DO concentration vs. volume-integrated DO.
4. Does anyone know of a good reference for the cost of the WWTP upgrade?
5. Difference between Tres and Tflush in MacCready et al. (2021). I think what I call "Tres" is what MacCready et al. (2021) calls "Tflush." 
6. How do I justify the depth of the interface?
7. Is it okay to leave the figures at the end of the text?
8. Chair of the supervisory committee?

## TO-DOs for paper

- Decide on journal
- Look at correlation between "Exchange Flow & Vertical Transport" and "Photosynthesis & Consumption," and discuss that the exchange flow brings nutrients and organic matter into inlets, which increases biological productivity.
- Expand analysis to more years
- Add model efficiency index
